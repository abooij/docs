# Ory Network: Understanding Workspaces and Environments

## Introduction

Ory Network has introduced two key concepts to enhance project management and resource allocation: Workspaces and Environments.
This guide explains these features and how they improve your experience with Ory Network.

## Workspaces: Your Organizational Hub

Workspaces serve as containers for your projects, offering several benefits:

1. **Unified Project Management**: Group related projects within a single Workspace.
2. **Simplified Billing**: One subscription per Workspace, covering all included projects.
3. **Centralized Access Control**: Manage user permissions across all Workspace projects from one place.

### Workspace Member Management

The Workspace Members page provides a comprehensive view of your team and access management:

- **Member Overview**: Quickly see the number of project members and total seats included in your plan.
- **Detailed Member List**: View all members, their roles, acceptance status, and when they were added.
- **Invite Functionality**: Easily invite new members directly from this interface.
- **Search and Filter**: Quickly find specific members using the search bar.

> Note: The screenshot shows that all members are listed as "Owners". In practice, you may have different roles such as Owner or Deleveper.

## Environments: Tailored Project Settings

Each Workspace includes three environment types, each designed for specific use cases:

| Environment | Purpose             | Features                    | Rate Limits                 |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Production  | Live applications   | Full Workspace subscription | Full Workspace subscription |
| Staging     | Pre-release testing | Full Workspace subscription | Development subscription    |
| Development | Active development  | Development subscription    | Development subscription    |

> Note: The number of projects allowed in each environment depends on your specific subscription or contract.

## Key Advantages

1. **Scalable Organization**: Manage multiple projects under one subscription, ideal for growing teams and applications.
2. **Flexible Allocation**: Easily adjust features and limits across projects within your Workspace.
3. **Streamlined Administration**: Simplify billing and user management with Workspace-level controls, as seen in the Members page
   screenshot.
4. **Clear Development Stages**: Distinct environments support a structured development lifecycle.
5. **Enhanced Value**: Get more features and higher limits compared to the previous per-project subscription model.

## Comparison with Previous Model

| Aspect                  | Previous Model      | New Workspace Model                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Project Organization    | Individual projects | Projects grouped in Workspaces               |
| Subscription Scope      | Per project         | Per Workspace                                |
| Environment Distinction | Not inherent        | Built-in (Production, Staging, Development)  |
| Resource Allocation     | Fixed per project   | Flexible across Workspace                    |
| User Management         | Per project         | Centralized per Workspace, with intuitive UI |

## Conclusion

Workspaces and Environments in Ory Network offer a more organized, flexible, and efficient approach to managing your projects. The
intuitive user interface, as demonstrated in the Members page screenshot, makes it easy to manage your team and resources. Whether
you're a small team or a large enterprise, this new structure provides the tools you need to scale and succeed with Ory Network.
