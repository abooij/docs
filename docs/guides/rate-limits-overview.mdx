This page provides a high-level overview of the rate limiting mechanisms employed by Ory to ensure system security and
availability. Rate limiting is crucial for protecting your applications against abuse and attacks, preventing service disruptions,
and ensuring fair usage for all our customers.

## Types of Rate Limits

Ory implements two main types of rate limits:

1. **Project-Based Rate Limits** ([link](/guides/project-based-rate-limits)): These limits are determined by your Ory subscription
   plan**1**. They define the maximum number of requests your projects can make to Ory's APIs within a given timeframe. This
   ensures fair resource allocation across all Ory projects.
   1. These limits are applied at the project level, meaning all requests originating from a specific project contribute to the
      rate limit counter for that project.
   2. Project-Based Rate Limits are defined in terms of: <br/>**Burst Limit:** This governs the maximum number of requests allowed
      per second, accommodating temporary spikes in traffic. <br/>**Sustained Limit:** This sets the maximum request count over a
      one-minute period, ensuring consistent and fair usage.
2. **Endpoint-Based Rate Limits** ([link](/guides/endpoint-based-rate-limits)): These limits focus on safeguarding specific
   endpoints of your Ory projects against common attack vectors like brute-force and credential stuffing attempts. They typically
   consider factors like source IP address and request frequency to identify and mitigate malicious activity.
   1. Endpoint-based rate limits act as a first line of defense for your project endpoints.These limits often leverage the source
      IP address as a key criterion, allowing Ory to identify and block requests originating from suspicious or malicious sources.
   2. By analyzing request patterns and incorporating factors like source IP, Ory can effectively differentiate between legitimate
      user traffic and potentially harmful bot activity.

## Benefits of Rate Limiting

- **Enhanced Security:** Rate limits help prevent attacks like brute-force and credential stuffing by restricting the number of
  attempts from a single source within a specific timeframe.
- **Improved Stability:** By limiting excessive requests, rate limiting protects your application from overload and potential
  downtime.
- **Fair Usage:** Project-based rate limits ensure fair resource allocation and prevent any single project from monopolizing
  shared resources.
