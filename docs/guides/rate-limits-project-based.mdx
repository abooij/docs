## Introduction

This page provides a comprehensive explanation of Ory's Project-Based Rate Limiting. These limits are designed to ensure fair
resource allocation and maintain the stability and performance of the Ory Network across different project plans and environments.

## What are Project-Based Rate Limits?

Project-Based Rate Limits are controls applied to your entire Ory project, governing the overall request volumes across various
API endpoints. These limits vary based on your project's plan (Developer, Production, Growth, or Enterprise) and the specific
environment (Production, Staging, or Workspace).

## How Project-Based Rate Limits Work

Project-Based Rate Limits analyze incoming requests across your entire project and consider factors such as:

- **Project Plan:** Different plans (Developer, Production, Growth, Enterprise) have different rate limit thresholds.
- **Environment:** Limits may vary between Production, Staging, and Workspace environments.
- **Request Path:** Specific API endpoints have different rate limits based on their typical usage patterns and importance.
- **Time Window:** Limits are applied using both per-second (burst) and per-minute (sustained) windows.

## Types of Rate Limits

Ory Network implements two types of rate limits for each policy:

1. **Burst Limit:** Limits the number of requests per second, allowing brief spikes in request volume.
2. **Sustained Limit:** Limits the number of requests over a one-minute period, ensuring consistent performance over time.

## Rate Limit Policies

Ory applies different rate limit policies based on the path of your request:

1. `/sessions/whoami`: Session checks
2. `/admin/oauth2/introspect`: OAuth2 token introspection
3. `/relation-tuples/check`: Permission checks
4. `GET /admin/identities`: List identities
5. `*`: All other paths

## Rate Limit Tables by Plan

### Developer Plan Rate Limits

| Environment   | Path / Bucket              | Burst (rps) | Sustained (rpm) |
| :------------ | :------------------------- | ----------: | --------------: |
| **Developer** | `/sessions/whoami`         |          10 |             300 |

## Important Notes on Project-Based Rate Limits

### Workspace Rate Limit

For all projects in a workspace, the rate limit is the same as for the production environment of your plan. For example, on the
Production plan, the rate limit would be 80 rps on the `/sessions/whoami` path for all projects combined in the workspace.

### Enterprise-Grade Rate Limits

For customers requiring higher rate limits or custom configurations, Ory offers enterprise-grade solutions. Please
[contact Ory](https://www.ory.sh/contact/) to discuss your specific requirements.

### Legacy Plans

The legacy Essential and Scale plans have the same rate limits as Production and Growth plans respectively.
